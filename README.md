# scope3-finance-pcaf

This project uses a mock loan book of 6 companies across multiple sectors (Energy, Transport, Retail, Agriculture, Technology).

Some companies have reported emissions, allowing direct allocation of financed emissions.

Others lack disclosures, requiring sector default intensities (per PCAF guidance).

This design demonstrates both pathways in the PCAF methodology â€” handling reported data where available, and applying sector averages where not.
